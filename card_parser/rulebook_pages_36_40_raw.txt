Special Rules
Character Abilities are listed on a character’s 
profile, or can be acquired through other 
means (such as Command Abilities).
Weapon Abilities are listed on a character’s 
weapon, and will take effect any time that 
weapon is used.
Some of these special rules have an (X) 
listed after them. That (X) is most often 
a number (such as Fast Swimmer (2) for 
example), which is referenced in the rule itself. 
A character may find they are affected by 
multiple instances of these special rules. These 
special rules stack to a maximum of 3 unless 
otherwise noted.
Character Abilities
Acrobatic (X)
This character may re-roll up to (X) dice 
when making a DEXTERITY roll as part  
of any Move/Climb or Jump action.
Aerial Attack
This character does not lose Life Points from 
falling, provided it makes a charge from above.
Berserk
If this character has 5 or fewer Life Points 
remaining at the start of its turn, it gains a +1 
bonus to its Action Points and +1 ATT ACK.
Boat Crew
This character may be set up on a Boat at the 
start of the game. This character replenishes  
1 Will Point at the start of its turn if it is on 
a Boat.
Additionally, if at least 1 character with the 
Boat Crew ability is currently on a Boat, 
the Cast Off Command Ability only costs 1 
Command Point, and the Boat may instead 
move up to 18”.Brave
This character automatically succeeds  
when making a Basic MIND roll from the 
Fear ability.
Brawler (X)
This character modifies its ATTACK by 
(X) when in base contact with 2 or more 
opponents.
Bodyguard (X)
For this special rule, (X) may be a character 
name or a character with a certain keyword . 
If an enemy character charges (X), this 
character may immediately make an out of 
sequence Run/Climb action provided it is 
currently out of base contact with any  
enemy and it charges that active enemy.  
This action causes an Attack of Opportunity 
and takes place before the opponent’s Attack 
of Opportunity.
Bulky
This character does not gain any benefit  
from being in cover, and cannot make  
Hide actions.
Companion (X)
For this special rule, (X) may be a character 
name or a character with a certain keyword . 
If this character can draw line of sight to 
another (X) character at the start of their 
turn, they replenish 1 Will Point.
In addition, while in line of sight to another 
(X) character they use that character’s 
MIND value instead of their own (even if it 
is lower). If more than one (X) character is in 
line of sight, use the highest MIND value.
Concealment (X)
While in cover this character modifies its 
PROTECTION by (X).

Engage
This character automatically wins the

however, then both players roll to disengage 
as normal.

This character may ignore all terrain  
while moving, but cannot end its turn 
or make any other actions while “inside”

action, the target must first make a Basic 
MIND Roll, with their MIND value 
modified by (X), to a minimum of 1. If they

is no effect. But if they roll no Aces, this 
character may re-roll any failed dice rolls for 
the Combat action.
First Strike (X)
This character modifies its ATTACK by (X) 
when making an Attack of Opportunity 
from charging.

MOVE (whether horizontally, vertically or 
diagonally, and this doesn’t have to be on 
Solid Ground) and move it without making 
a DEXTERITY roll. It cannot make any 
actions while “mid-air” other than further 
Fly actions, and if it ends its turn “mid-air”  
it will fall from that spot. Additionally,  this 
character takes 2 less Damage from falling.

Weapon Abilities
Aquatic
This weapon can be used while the attacker 
is in water. 
Black Powder
This weapon cannot be used if a character 
starts its turn in water.
In addition, a character using this weapon 
loses 1 additional Life Point when they roll a 
Fumble during an Attack Roll. 
Blast
This weapon uses the round blast marker. 
Place the blast marker centred over the 
target. Roll once for your Attack Roll and 
apply the roll to every individual character 
(friendly and enemy) under the template.
Harmless
A character cannot cause any Damage when 
using this weapon, but still follows normal 
rules for making Combat actions.
Knockback
If a character takes Damage from this 
weapon (whether they lose Life Points or 
not), they are moved 2” horizontally directly 
away from the attacker. This movement does 
not count as charging or disengaging, and 
cannot cause Attacks of Opportunity.Reload (X)
This weapon may only be used for up to (X) 
Combat actions in each round.
A character in base contact with an enemy 
may only use this weapon (X) number of 
times (modified by the amount already used 
that round). Once that number has been 
reached, the weapon may not be used again 
until the character starts their turn out of 
base contact with any enemies.
For example, a weapon with Reload (2) is used 
once in a character’s turn. They are then charged 
in the same round. The character may then only 
use that weapon one more time until they start a 
turn out of base contact.
Poisoned
If a character loses at least 1 Life Point from 
this weapon, that character must roll 1 dice. 
On a 7+ they shrug off the poison. On a 1-6, 
they lose extra Life Points depending on 
their Base Size:
• 30mm models lose 3 Life Points.
• 40mm models lose 4 Life Points.
• 50mm models lose 5 Life Points.
• 60mm+ models lose 6 Life Points.

Smoke
Any character hit by this weapon counts as 
being in cover until the end of the round, 
and gains a Hidden counter. If this weapon 
also has the Blast ability, any character under 
the marker is affected. Remove the marker at 
the end of the round.
Stun
If a character takes Damage from this 
weapon (whether they lose Life Points or 
not) they receive a Stunned counter.
A character with a Stunned counter reduces 
its MOVE, ATTACK, DEXTERITY, 
and MIND by 1 (to a minimum of 1). A 
character automatically removes its Stunned 
counter at the end of its next turn. A 
character can only have one Stunned counter 
at a time.
If a character with a Stunned counter starts 
its turn in water it loses 2 Life Points.Template
This weapon uses the teardrop shaped 
template.  
Trace a line between the attacker and the 
target. Place the template with the centre on 
the line with the small end of the template in 
range of the weapon (base contact with the 
attacker if the range is 0”), and the large end 
further away from the attacker. Any character 
at least partly touched by the template 
(friendly or enemy) is affected by the attack. 
Roll once for your Attack Roll and apply the 
roll to every individual character hit.
